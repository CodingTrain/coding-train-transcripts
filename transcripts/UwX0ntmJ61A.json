    "transcription": " Yes Hello welcome Welcome to a special afternoon coding trade with our special guest no op cat I was saying it wrong. I was saying noob cat which I guess is everybody Everyone loves new cat so it's totally okay, but you know up, so if you don't know no op cat Suze Hinton yes, no op cats streams on twitch on Sundays. Yes, I will include Links and all of that in this videos description when it gets published You could probably find it through the magical world right now, but you shouldn't go find it because you should stay and watch Yeah, we're gonna have some fun today. Yeah, and we're gonna so No op cat knows all sorts of stuff that I don't know about especially like how to use I term I Term is here, so that's that's exciting for one I don't actually I don't even know if any of this is working because usually I put the chat there to monitor I'm gonna go look We're gonna assume. This is all working fine in a minute I'm gonna go sit over there with a laptop tune to the live chat and so if questions come in If you have questions you can ask them. I'll try to keep track of them. I can get interrupt This is very informal probably everything's gonna go wrong as it always does One thing that's also very exciting is we're gonna make use of this overhead camera. Oh, yeah, isn't this one? Yeah, yeah, there's gonna be some hardware look hardware stuff So that's new and very exciting for the coding train. I didn't really do a good job I feel like introducing you but no no yeah, this is really fun And so let me let me quickly go over and check yeah sure everything seems okay In the chat otherwise we're gonna be doing this again, and then just just interrupt me if it's not good I can do an intro does this seem right? Everything looks good and sounds good So you can introduce yourself. I'm gonna mute my microphone, okay, but then if questions come in or if I'm to say something I'll unmute yeah Just jump in whenever if anyone has any questions about what I'm doing Because I may actually skip over stuff that you're just like wait. She said a word that I don't know just let me know Thank you, Dan for having me. I'm so excited I'm such a fangirl of the coding train, so I'm like really excited to be here and also So I do a lot of hardware stuff, so I wanted to sort of briefly intro myself on that I work on a lot of open source JavaScript hardware Which I know for some of you you might not typically associate JavaScript with hardware but I promise that it's actually super fun to get started with it and It's really really quick to prototype with JavaScript hardware, so that's kind of its main attraction But you can also just create your own kind of fully implemented like real Contraptions and still run JavaScript to control it, so I'm gonna show you one way of controlling Hardware with JavaScript today. We are going to be working with an Arduino And it's an Arduino Uno Which is kind of the most common one that a lot of people get started with and we're gonna be driving this thing called an OLED screen, and I'm gonna explain all this just to make sure that Dan's not super scared Because Dan told me he's really afraid of hardware and I'm really afraid of Generative art because I feel like I'm not good at it So I'm trying to combine the two together because Dan's really good at generative art so somewhere in the middle We're gonna find like a nice happy place where we're both learning something so hopefully it's gonna go well, so yeah Thanks so much for joining us. I'm so excited. I'm normally streaming on a Sunday, and yeah I'm streaming on a Friday, which is blowing my mind, so yeah Anything is it all going good? No, that's great. I would say that I'm not very good Maybe I'm I'm good if anything I might know how to like implement the generative algorithms But I'm not good at like making something beautiful out of them, okay? So we're gonna do like a super simple one today, and then maybe the viewers can help us with stuff, but Yeah, so I am going to just take you through a couple of the tools that we're going to be using today Just forgive me. This is not my computer, so we had some sort of last-minute shenanigans But I think it's gonna be okay So I'm going to be using Johnny five which is kind of the beloved hardware JavaScript Framework it has been designed to be like the jQuery of hardware So if you've ever used jQuery before then you know that it's a really nice API It's super accessible to get started with it, so Johnny five was designed by one of the contributors to JQuery Rick Waldron, and he's on a fantastic job, and there's been a lot of contributors ever since I think there's at least 70 something contributors now and that that was when I checked a couple of years ago, so it's probably even bigger now So we're going to be using this without Arduino So if you wanted to follow along with some of the beginning code examples that we'll be using today You can go to Johnny dash five dot io it's kind of like the short-circuit robot character so I really like that it's named after that and We're also going to be making use of a module that I wrote a little while ago about three or four years ago and it's called Oleg Js and Oleg is the type of screen that this is it's an Oleg screen Just meaning that the little pixels that are showing up on the screen are actually driven by Oleg's Which is like a type of led and? So I wrote this module to be compatible with Johnny five so that you can just start Really easily drawing to the screen without having to know a lot of the stuff that's going on underneath So I'll cover a little bit more on that when we actually get started, but we're also going to be using that as well So I wanted to give a shout out to my friend Tim Holman because he's actually the one that finally got me playing with generative Art super recently we hung out at JSConfAU in Australia And he gave this awesome talk about generative art And how you just need a few simple things in a toolkit to get started with and it's the first time I felt like not Afraid to do it So I just wanted to say you should check out Tim Holman's website It's tholman.com and yeah, he does really really really hilariously funny stuff on the internet So you should absolutely check him out, so I wanted to thank him for finally getting me started with it So the generative art that we're going to create today is well at least on this website It's called a pseudo maze is that what it's actually called Dan Is that what it's called Is it that you just pick randomly like a left or right yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, actually it may yes Yeah, no, that's exactly I have a coding challenge. That's exactly that Yes from the old Commodore 64 That makes sense so that's perfect. This is very good synergy So I noticed also that you did like a coding challenge on Floyd Steinberg. Yes, yeah, so Displaying like photos or just like high-resolution images on these screens It's very effective to use the Floyd Steinberg over them, too So this is me trying to get you less afraid of hardware because you're still using the exact same stuff on this So if we have time, I don't think we will but if we have time I can also show like displaying pictures on this thing But for today, we're actually just going to work with lines, which is super simple to do and Just to kind of like explore the concepts of generative art So if you've already seen dance coding challenge, this is going to be pretty similar But it's gonna allow you to see how you then apply it to something like hardware, I guess So I think it'll still be super interesting. So thanks for tuning in Okay, so that's sort of a super quick crash course to stuff. I do actually have a Folder right now that I've created I did pre-install some stuff ahead of time just so that you know We don't have to sort of like sit around waiting for npm to install but I will be doing this with node.js today Which is a way of running JavaScript outside of the browser, which is really cool. So if you go to node.js org Just like that. You should be able to read up about it, but it's it's really really cool So that's kind of what Johnny 5 runs on top of but recently I did get it working in the browser But that's for another episode probably Cool so I have this folder here. I've installed Johnny 5. I've installed OLED JS Just those two packages that I showed you before and that's it. And then we have a code editor here I didn't quite get BIM set up I was on a mission to get them going because if you've seen my stream before you all know that I use BIM But so we're using Visual Studio Code instead and then we're gonna just keep crossing back and forth between Iterm and Visual Studio Code. So let me know if you can't read anything and Dan will yell at me and then Cool. So, um, so I do actually have the Arduino plugged in right now as you should be able to see So we're not actually going to plug anything into it yet. We just want to kind of establish a Connection to it first just to make sure you know that we can do our little hello world and then we'll start plugging in this Screen, so I sort of wanted to do a lot of this stuff from scratch just so you can kind of see it from the beginning So I've created a blank file called art.js because that's what we're creating today and I'm going to start just by Requiring the dependencies that I actually need so in In Node.js with JavaScript instead of maybe doing import which you could do I'm just going to be using require which basically says Hey, I've installed these libraries and I actually want to start using them so I can then assign them to variables So I think the first thing I want is Johnny five So I'm just going to call that five for short just because it's quicker to type And then I'm just going to require that and it should be smart enough to figure that out because Visual Studio Code is kind of amazing So that's me actually requiring Johnny five and saying that that library from now on when I want to access it. It's called five The next thing I want is the actual OLED library and because that's a class I'm gonna capitalize it and let's see if it's smart enough to figure this one out It did it. Oh, there we go. Just ask a quick question. Do you have? Like a package that JSON file like is the Johnny five node module already installed. Did you talk about that? Well, I was looking at I did I'm not gonna ask any more questions. It is really cool, but I can show you the package.json Just real quick so you can actually see what that looks like if you've never seen it before So if you have a look down towards the bottom of that file, you've got dependencies. You've got Johnny five and all that Yes, so yeah, but really really glad that we just went back over that because I know that I was talking a million miles an hour Okay. So now that we have them We can actually start working with them. So before we do anything with this OLED screen We want to just test that Johnny five is working and is able to talk to the device, right? So we can do like a hello world with it but I kind of wanted to first describe on the whiteboard kind of how Johnny five actually talks to the Arduino before we actually start on that. So let's go do that Okay, so we've got our computer right here and this is kind of the confusing thing For some people to understand exactly how Johnny five works, so I'm gonna draw a really bad keyboard here, but you get the idea And then this this this computer is like, okay. Well, I want to talk to this Arduino, right so We can have back-and-forward communication with it So let's just say that this is the Arduino Everything has a smiley face, too So this is the Arduino so what's actually happening when we run Johnny five is that Every time we start that node.js process it actually uses this really cool library called serial port to establish like a two-way connection between the Arduino and the device the Laptop itself and what it actually speaks is called the Firmata protocol, which I don't know if you've heard of before Dan I have yeah, so have you used this before? I I think I went to a workshop once where somebody was teaching with Firmata I know that students sometimes here use it, but mostly the students at ITP use like the Arduino Sort of directly. Okay, that makes sense. Yeah, and so if you wanted to use the Arduino directly This particular Arduino we're using today only sort of understands C++ So that's why we sort of wanted to start with something a bit higher level and it's a little bit easier to sort of stay on your machine So if you're using Firmata, you can you can write the Arduino code basically in JavaScript Yes, you can write sort of like you can basically become the remote control for the Arduino through the Firmata protocol So we have like our JavaScript which understands the Firmata protocol and then we have a C++ script Running on this board here, which understands the Firmata protocol, too And that's like an out-of-the-box thing you download and run on the exactly so I'm gonna actually run that on my well I'm gonna run like a very quick script to install that on my Arduino's And I'm gonna show you how to do that so that you don't even have to download the Arduino ID or anything So we can do that and the way that these talk to each other is because they know the same language Which is Firmata. They just kind of send opcodes between each other. So that's not even a zero so, you know, maybe 0 FF or just that's like a Byte that is value like 255. Maybe that means something very Like substantial in the Firmata protocol. Maybe it means hey Start sending power to this pin so that you can turn an LED on or something like that I don't actually have the Firmata protocol memorized, but I do know that it is based on the MIDI Protocol so it uses like like I guess the notes and everything Which is I think a really really cool part of like Firmata's history is that it uses MIDI to do it So that's like a super high level view of how it actually does it just because the stuff that we're working with today is so Heavily abstracted so we want to just make sure that you still understand that this is walkie-talkie thing happening and that the JavaScript Never actually goes and lives on this device. It's just really just a remote control So and we're gonna have a whole different protocol talking to the actual screen, which I'll draw here later on as well Cool. All right, do it Okay, so now that we've got our dependencies we actually want to make sure that it's talking to the device now I mentioned before that the Arduino needs to actually know What the Firmata protocol is right? So we actually have like a pre-made sketch that Arduino Itself publishes with the IDE and it's called standard Firmata and so we want to use that but having to open the Arduino IDE and then flash a Script to the Arduino and then close it again It's sort of just annoying because that's the only thing you use it for so I ended up making a package and it's called Firmata party and I think I installed this on Dan's machine I did so what Firmata party does is it allows you to have a party with Firmata by just being able to Transfer the Firmata script onto the Arduino device that you actually have So that's literally all it does but it does actually get you started and up and running really quickly So it's just a command line up that I wrote in Node.js So we can run Firmata party and then we're gonna write the name of the Arduino board that It's actually supposed to be flashing so that it knows what to look for that's plugged in So someone in the chat is asking is the JavaScript transpiled or interpreted? Or is the Firmata? Does Firmata interpret the language or transpile? Maybe this question doesn't I don't know if that question makes sense I think I'm really confused. But I think that so the Firmata The Firmata protocol itself Yeah, it's a protocol but the scripts that are running because that's a really good question the scripts that are running are just basically looping and listening for any messages that come into the device or that the device sends to the To the laptop itself So they're actually listening for Firmata packets or just like MIDI notes And then there are interpreters on either side that are interpreting those up codes and doing the right thing with them So hopefully that answers the question do you need in this setup that you're using I don't know if I'm jumping too far ahead Obviously you need your computer there to write the node code You're gonna write once that's finished Could this work just with the Arduino and the display or no because of Firmata the JavaScript stuff has to run on your yes Yeah, that's so that C code C++ code is compiled and the JavaScript is just running exactly Yeah, so the only code that ever runs on this device at least in this setup You can use Johnny five wirelessly, which is kind of cool and you can run Johnny five on Devices that run Linux. So for example a Tesla 2 is able to run Johnny 5, which is awesome What happens is that the script on the Arduino never ever changes? So it's literally just a listener that's listening for those Firmata commands to come from the computer and the JavaScript always stays on the laptop and that's the I guess the USB connection between the two is like the kind of the telephone game that it's playing if that makes sense so so if you've got any follow-up questions for that, let me know because It's a really really good question And I don't feel I explained it and and scanline in the chat writes firmata is like remote control GPIO or serial I think it's a good that's a really good way of saying it. Also. I'm so excited that scan My god, I think scanline is awesome. So I just wanted to say hi and I watch your live streams as well Now I'm like super nervous. Okay So we're gonna run from my party, you know literally all that does is it takes the firmata C++ script that the Arduino needs to run and it just uploads it and then We don't actually upload any scripts to the Arduino After this we're just running JavaScript on the laptop as we said to just kind of send stuff to that firmata scripts that's running And it's really just sending commands. It's not actually sending any code or anything like that So hopefully that actually works. It seemed to have worked. I think that I Think that I need to do dash V just to see if it did. Oh Wait, no, maybe it's debug. Anyway, I can see that it's actually working So maybe it is dash dash debug. Let's see. Ah, there we go Just so you can actually see what it's doing. So it says found uno on port blah it connected the reset was complete It's flashing the code and then we have a nice green status saying that it's successfully completed So now that we have firmata running on the device It's actually ready to start listening for any commands that come in by that USB connection so Now that we have a five instance. We want to create a board, right? So we want to create this board instance to that So then we can start kind of sending stuff to the board and receiving stuff from the board So I think we just need to do a new Five dot board I think wow this autocomplete blowing my mind. I don't use I don't use Visual Studio code very often, but it is like super nice Okay, so we have a new board what that actually does is it just goes and like looks at all the serial ports Or the USB I guess ports on your computer and it goes a you and Arduino a you and Arduino a you and Arduino So it's actually really awesome because it takes a lot of that stuff out of your responsibility to do So then the board comes back as an object that you can listen to events on again This is very similar to jQuery. So normally where you would have like document dot ready Or document dot on ready you can actually do like board on ready, which is actually pretty chill So I feel like Dan you could totally do this So I'm following everything so far, okay, I just the problem is if I touch the hardware it might spontaneously So sometimes I have turned something on and I've smelt burning or the Bread board is melting but that's usually if I'm doing something super dumb and it's not with the Arduino. So the Arduino is pretty safe Okay. So now that we I don't like to have Four spaces, so I'm just gonna do my space bar so now that we have and like with it's sort of attached a listener to the ready event which basically says that We've been able to guarantee that there's a good connection happening with the Arduino We just want a console log out that it's actually ready so we can just write Yay, I guess and then let's try and run this just before we sort of get ahead of ourselves and start writing extra stuff So So I'm gonna do node. I think art dot JS. Let's see what happens All right seems to have found it and then we got yay. So that's pretty cool What Johnny five does too is it it actually gives you a rebel which is a I think of read evaluate print loop which is really cool because you can actually start looking at anything that you create globally to be accessible in the In the rebel, so we're not really going to use that today, but I just wanted to say that it's a really nice feature So by me writing this that's actually the instance of the board So you can see a whole bunch of stuff comes out if you wanted to inspect that further so to exit I'm just gonna do I'm just gonna send like the Control C just the the second twice and then or the interrupts. I forget which one it is But yeah, so we're gonna do that. Are there any questions so far? Well, there are there might be questions but actually everybody is saying it's really easy in Visual Studio code to change the two spaces Okay, you should be aware that if you ever mentioned anything about like The chat all the only thing anybody discusses in the chat. I should have actually Remembered that because my stream is really similar. So what is the command? I think it's just in People are saying it's in the bottom, right? Oh, that's really easy Indent using spaces and then we want to Wow All you folks are the best I figured that you might be saying something like that. Okay, so it didn't do it for the default. So Let's do indent using spaces and then let's do two. Yeah So, okay. So what happens if I go to a new line? Yeah Okay. Thanks everybody. This is very very helpful I'm not gonna start an editor war or anything like that. I'll have to be really careful about what I'm gonna say Cool. Um, okay So we want to actually start using this screen now because that's really the only thing that we're going to do With like using Johnny five is to be able to use it to speak with the screen directly So we kind of have to go over a little bit of theory of what we're doing today But we also want to plug in the screen as well. So I think we're actually going to start with the theory first So let's do that All Right, so we have this this here but I sort of wanted to just start like a new section over here just for now So we wanted to create this generative tile effect. So we want to sort of explain that first. So let's imagine that our screen is is here a little tiny OLED screen and The maze before looked really complicated if you if you're sort of not able to break it up with your eyes But what it really is is it's just a grid So this is what we're going to be programming today and this is not actually to scale of what the screen Actually is but it's just giving you an example of Like a really small Cutaway of the screen that we're going to be doing so in order to create this generative art pattern We actually are just going to draw one of two things So we're going to generate a random number and then depending on you know Whether the number is more than 0.5 or not. We're going to draw a line that's Facing like either, you know, it's either pointing one way or it's pointing the other so we have like one of two lines So it's going to be either this line or it's going to be this line. That's it So it's either going to be leaning forward or it's going to be leaning back So for example, if I was to use my brain to do this, which is actually harder than it looks We can just start sort of generating these lines But you know if we let the computer do it instead it's it's going to be a lot quicker Oh, and we might actually get some really nice effects out of it So that's sort of how that algorithm actually works We just split the screen up into tiles and then we just figure out How to actually draw those lines by cutting up the screen into pieces. So hopefully that made sense Cool. So the actual screen itself that we're using is The dimensions are 128 by 64, so I want you to remember those dimensions because they're like super super important And I was going to explain how the screen actually works But I might just leave that till the end if anyone's got questions about it But because I did write the actual screen Library, I can actually explain to you how it actually is able to take pixel data and stuff like that But for today, maybe we'll just keep going with that Cool so on the screen actually speaks a protocol called I to C or It's actually I think technically I squared C But I always call it I to C because that's just like how I read it, but it stands for I think inter-integrated Communication I think scanline is going to know the answer So it's a it's a way of communicating and it's actually a really really cool Protocol because it's very efficient. It doesn't take a lot of wires And you get a lot of control over things like the clock speed and things like that So I'll try not to get too deep in the weeds, but it's really cool to kind of know how these devices actually work so generally you have Two different devices, right? so I'm just trying to make sure that you can actually all see this and I'm not going off the edge of the screen, but We have our Arduino here Now our do we know is known as the master and then we have our screen Sorry inter integrated circuit bus. Thank you that I always think it's connection instead of circuit bus But yeah, so okay so into integrated circuit bus, which is really cool So we have our Arduino and we have our screen so the Arduino is known in this I to C or I squared C relationship as the master and then the screen is Known in this relationship as the slave no, I don't really like the whole master-slave kind of Like metaphor. So I like to call this Arduino the captain and The screen is the sailor so we're gonna go with them today because I think it's a really cute Metaphor. So the captain is responsible for like, you know Sending out commands to the to like the crew on the ship, right and the sailor always takes that direction So generally the captain is controlling the whole scenario and the sailor is just kind of like carrying out those commands So that's like the best way to think of it. And so in I squared C We have our regular power and ground, but we also have like two other connections So this is getting a little bit small, but one is the clock and the other one is just like the data line So we have only one line that we need to use in order to send the beeps and boops back and by the beeps and Boops, I guess I mean the zeros and the ones and then the clock is an external Is an external kind of wire as well because then we can actually Without getting too much into like how this stuff works We can use the clock externally to actually specify the speed at which we want everything to run So I squared C is actually a really cool protocol If you want to read more about it, you can definitely look on sites like spark fun and other sites because it's super super cool So that's what we're going to be using today in order for our Arduino to actually like talk to that screen So you don't see a lot of that when I'm actually coding Because I've heavily abstracted that but that's sort of the gist of what what's going on today So I guess that's what we're gonna do. So let's let's get going Well, I think we have a camera Oh It was probably the overhead one so that worked out well In that one now there because we turn them all at the same time I can't believe that was half an hour already that that went so fast. Okay. So how we doing on time? We're so we're fine on time I think there was a question that I noted at one point I don't you know, this might have been from a little while ago. So apologies for this mess of the momentum But so how much space? Well, actually, I think I might know the answer to this question But how much space is for modern all these JS libraries take up on the Arduino? Is that a concern? Yeah, that's a really good question. So I know that the standard formata C++ script for the Arduino is a pretty big one Whenever new features want to be added to formata. Sometimes you have to take other features away So that's why we have standard formata. And then sometimes we have other versions that have like extra things put in there. So This is an Arduino, you know, so it has three twenty eight bytes or kilobytes Of memory, so there's not a lot on there. And so it does kind of mean that I'm sorry 32 kilobytes I believe yes, so it's got 32 kilobytes And that means that you don't have a lot of room The good news is that the JavaScript that we're running never actually ends up on the device so if the Formata scripts that we flash before successfully flush to the device then we know it's going to fit obviously that that matters when it comes to things like If you have variables or it's trying to buffer a lot of the messages coming through on the device You might actually see those difficulties as well So when you're running a program you also want to leave enough room or have enough good data structures In order to deal with the fact that there are a lot of messages coming through that the device has to hold on to for A little bit. So as usual with with everything it's always balanced But that's a really good question and just to remind you the JavaScript never actually goes to the device The JavaScript is simply just controlling the device instead So the JavaScript is just sending up codes to the device so that we don't have to worry about that huge overhead of how big JavaScript would be to send to it Cool so the next thing we want to do actually is to plug the OLED screen in and start interacting with it So if I have the overhead camera, sorry We have a bunch of different wires. So actually let's go back and look at the documentation for a led.js So I tried to document this as as good as possible But I'm always looking for pull requests or issues if you find anything confusing so the SDL That's mentioned just just over here. That's actually the data line and then you've got SEL which is the clock line So I've been pretty clear about if you're using an Arduino UNO, then these are the pins to use for each the reset has to go to 4 and then you've got your standard power and grounds which I usually don't document just because It's pretty easy to do a one-for-one with those So I will actually show that being plugged in before we actually get started So I have my Arduino here and I have power ground Resets clock and data lines. So that ends up being a total of five different cables But it is actually still pretty efficient. It is still I think less cables than SPI and that's just because the reset line is actually I hate to pause you. Yeah. Yeah I think I'm getting a message that maybe we could Focus this camera a little better. Okay, so let's do that. I don't know what I'm doing at all It looks a little That's zoom. That's changing. Okay, maybe it's like on the rim No, wait, is that still yeah, no, I'm focusing definitely it's just Okay, that looks like I'm looking at the Arduino the word yeah, that looks way better. I think that's pretty okay Yes that that is definitely I mean, I'm probably not gonna get it perfect But hopefully that's yeah Feel free to tell to tell Dan to tweak it as well if you need to So so this is kind of the reset wire is not joined to the others So it's usually the easiest one for me to connect first So it says in the documentation that reset has to go to pin 4 on the Arduino So you might not be able to actually see this but there is a little tiny 4 numeral next to that little pin input And so I'm I'm literally just trying to connect each one To the correct one as listed in my documentation So I like to use red for power and black for ground So I'm gonna go ahead and plug them in because they're always like super easy Especially if you've done this a couple of times before so I just plugged them into ground and power and that just leaves our clock and our Data line. So our data line is actually the brown cable. Our clock is the white again You can make up whatever convention you want But I like to use white for clock because it's just like my own little personal thing that I'll always remember so the clock I believe needs to be pin a 5 which is an analog pin and then a 4 is the data line. So the reason why we use a 4 and a 5 is because most Arduino boards come with I squared C Capabilities built in but they use very specific pins to do that so for an Arduino, you know, the a 4 and a 5 pins are your clock and data lines for For this particular board, so it's not sort of arbitrary. This is kind of how The Arduino board has been set up. The reset pin was just an arbitrary choice by me So We have a lot of this code here already We just need to write these middle bits here And so we have to pass some options in to tell it what size screen we have We have to give it the address of the device itself which can vary per screen And then we also have to create a new instance of our OLED screen So we're just going to go ahead and do that in the code now in order to sort of start connecting to it You're still you know So I'm going to show you that again, so it's just these lines here We're just going to be doing something very similar to this But I'm just going to walk you through it instead of copying and pasting. So let's create Some options and by the way, this is old documentation. That's not using the most modern JavaScript So we're still sort of using var and things like that It's up to you if you want to pull request that I sort of have just left it old so that people don't necessarily have To use transpilers to be able to use those new features, but it depends on what version of node they're using I think most people are on version 4 at least now, so that's good Okay, so I need to pass in options so that my screen library kind of knows how to control this device so before I actually Put that in I'm going to establish just some some some constant variables that are not going to change So I'm going to call that width so the width is going to be 128 pixels and The height is going with is going to be us 64 yes, that's right. So we're going to be divisible by 8 So that's going to be the size of the screen. I also want to establish something just ahead of time Called the tile size and that's just because we want to be able to change this and have the algorithm kind of automatically You know adjust itself based on how big or small we want those tiles So we're going to start with a tile size of four and we're going to see how we go and then I can change that To let you know how that works later on I keep trying to do my VIM shortcuts It's like it's like a what's it called like a muscle memory okay, so now we can actually set the width to be width and a shorthand of doing that in More modern JavaScript is just to list these and Then we need the address. So I know for a fact that the address of this particular board is 3d you can think of an address as An I squared C devices like phone number so you can have multiple I2 I squared C devices connected to the those analog pins and if they all have different phone numbers It's not always the case. Sometimes it's annoyingly not that case But you can have like let's say five different screens connected and if all they all have a different address or phone number you can actually kind of control them all without having to kind of Like pull pull wires out and swap them around and stuff like that So just think of the address as us kind of like being very specific about which device we want to speak to that's connected to that I squared C bus So now that we have the address and I don't know why but I'm a semicolon person So I'm going to put some semicolons in once we have the options and we've said sort of you know This is the minimum set of kind of properties you need to give to get this going We're gonna create a new variable and let's call it screen because that's actually easier to kind of reason about than OLED We're gonna create a new OLED screen. I think that's what I called my dependency. Yes, and Let's pass in the options Cool. I kind of want to run that just to make sure I haven't completely screwed something up Okay, cool So it couldn't get the height and I actually know why that is so I'm not actually using my library properly So we do actually need to pass in a couple of other arguments We need to pass in our board and our five instances because this is a separate thing to Johnny five We actually need to be able to give it those things so it can actually use Johnny five to communicate So we're gonna go back to the code and we will pass that in. So I think it was bored and then five I hope that's that's right, but we'll just guess There's nothing like reading your own documentation All right, so I'm glad I tested that because it definitely blew up it looks like this is okay So I'm just gonna stop this process and then we'll keep going. So we definitely want to Make sure first that the screen is working But then we want to clear the screen because sometimes when you start this screen up it can have sort of some snow on it Kind of like an old-school analog TV. I guess you still get snow just digital snow now on digital TVs so one of the first commands that I want to show you for this is Is screen dark clear display? And then we can call screen dot update just to just to make sure that that actually gets sent to the device So now if we run this Let's see if we can cross to the camera So all I'm really doing is running the same file But if we look at the camera, you might be able to see there's a little bit of snow on there right now You can sort of see that it at least did a thing and then it's very very subtle We might actually have to turn the one of the lights out Let's take a minute here to see if we can make this a little better. Yeah, so We didn't really get a chance to test this thing Yeah, so I wonder if I can do I think what might actually work better somebody gave this suggestion is I'll just call this scene 2. Go for it. So, but sorry everybody you're seeing nothing now. So what I'm gonna do is add How do I do this? Video capture device I think Add existing. Nope And Black magic device. Okay, so I'm gonna just put all these in the laptop is there now. I'm just gonna rebuild the new No, no, no, don't be sorry this is exciting I've never used this before this is worth trying to figure out and We can always make an edited version of this tutorial, which I often do I feel like I'm getting Yeah, that's what I love I've had to fix my stream midstream before too and it's always very interesting This and then what I thought I would try to do so like when it changes Yeah, I'm gonna do is I'm gonna add now black magic device Overhead oh, we're gonna combine though I think what might make more sense is just to put this like you can crop that and then crop it Yeah, so how do I crop you hold down alt I? Can hold it down? And then you just drag the handle. So let's go over to hot tip right there. Yeah, I'll crop this like is this good? Yeah, that's good Yeah, this is how I set up my stream and now so take off the alt right yeah, and so now I can zoom Yeah, that's good. So this is so basically like I don't know if it makes if it looks better if it's kind of like I'm gonna like I could probably this is my I have a problem. I could sit here and do this for like hours I'm not going to like if it's just kind of here. Okay, maybe that looks good. Now. The question is it's swaying So is that because this? It might be I hope we're not making a you I guess do I have any sandbags we might at one point I had sandbags up here But if we bring up the code they kind of can't see that oh no Okay, so what you would do is still switch here we turn that off Okay, and then I would have to map I don't have that map to a key. Mm-hmm, so I could do it though Let's why not so this is we're good. We have time nobody people. This is what probably people's favorite part of this It's the wizard behind the curtain No op cat yeah Okay, so and then I what I have to do unfortunately is go into settings Hot keys and I'm looking for do you want five? Show switch to scene you just give me and put a number in there five great. So now try doing try hitting one Let me let me lock all these I think I messed it up Okay, okay Try hitting one. Yeah. Oh now try hitting five. I love that I shrink. I think that's a feature And maybe I put something heavy yeah, how about a book of rain Will this stop it from I have to wait? It's still kind of sweating. I might not be able to do anything too much. That's just my hopefully though See it a little bit better now now the question is oh we could turning out lights or zooming in more but focus People are telling me the focus. Yes, I think it Let me put something on the screen because that was gonna be my next Screen draw a line I'm gonna do zero zero. This is a spoiler alert Yeah, people see it 60 Yeah, and then I don't know 12 So, let's see if the line draws just so that we can actually focus on it, oh is it in the way This is I'm like learning how to do So so line didn't draw Oh ha ha ha Cuz I don't know we're in library Yeah Okay, oh yes, you can totally see that that's yeah There's a line so you might see that the frame rate the refresh rate of like the camera and everything might do a Ripley thing There's literally nothing we can do about that. I'm sorry I have tried to solve that on my own stream before and I wasn't able to but you should you get the gist? Yeah, all right. So I'm gonna go I haven't looked at the chat probably Sway I feel like somehow the swaying isn't as bad if it's not the full screen for some reason cuz at least you're grounded I just love that I shrink. Yeah, wait five, right? Yeah We could also make it fade in between the two, but I don't know I'm so good I'm gonna come back over here. Okay, and then make the webcam for the hardware small Okay, so we just have to remember when you want people to see the code to hit that okay, yeah that makes sense so That was kind of the next bit that I was gonna do. I was gonna draw a line. So So just just like have it. Hmm So it's not gonna matter when we do the generative art like what orientation the screen is But what I did was think of this screen as being upside down If we go back to the code really quick, I'll show you that so what we essentially did was we We took the method draw line The first argument is the X the starting X position The next argument is the starting Y position and then we've got the ending the end X position and Y position So it's basically starting at the top corner of the screen and then it's drawing across like almost halfway Like horizontally and then it's going down just a little tiny bit as well. So hopefully that makes sense So I'll just pop that up for you to see one more time again That screen is upside down, but that's sort of like the general gist of how it is You know what? I'm gonna do actually I'm gonna flip this Because you can oh I have it locked. Oh, but you can I think I can do transform Yeah, it's a cheetah Cool, so that actually makes more sense. So let me know if that angle is better I know some people get a little bit sick depending on like whether it's upside down or not But that is what you would expect there So it's starting at zero zero and then it's going across a little bit and down a little bit So the one here is just what color I actually want to do and by color I mean the pixels either on it's like shining in a white sort of color or it's just off So you can actually draw with like negative color and you can just clear out parts of the pixels, which is kind of cool So just remember that one just always means the pixels on So I do actually want to change this library quite a bit because I did write it a few years ago I would love to have an enum So it would be something like colors dot white or something or color dot on or pixel dot on pixel dot off or something like That I think that would be a lot more effective But I'm interested to hear people's thoughts again raise an issue if you think that you have an idea on that Another thing that I can do is I can basically tell it not to update the screen immediately So we can do a lot of like manipulations first and then update the screen all at once We're probably gonna do that today because there's no point in drawing each line individually and kind of bottlenecking the USB connection So another one we can do is we can say False for like don't draw immediately, I guess So we can't see the code right now. Oh Keep doing that. Oh, you have to click back in you have to like the mouse has to be clicked back in Yeah, thank you Okay, no wait What did I do Did I break it Usually I feel like always manually mouse to the other view Okay, but no as long as you click, but it should be that you just have to click into this. Okay Now the hot oh Okay, nice. Yeah, I have a slightly different setup with OBS. So I think that's why I'm being stern Cool, so I can show you that message as well. I think Draw line. Yep draws a one pixel white line and Yeah, you can say whether or not the screen immediately updates with the result so cool So this is literally all we need in our repertoire today in order to start doing this generative art So everything else is kind of more like the algorithm, but this is definitely like the fastest way to get started with drawing on an OLED screen So I'll just show you that one more time There's the line there so we're just going to be drawing lines in different patterns across like invisible tiles on this screen Cool. So we have our tile size and we have our width and height. So we're going to make be making heavy use of these We're going to be creating just a couple of helper functions as well in order to kind of start drawing this so the first function I want is to Create a vector because we want a lot of things where we're dealing with XY coordinates And you don't really get that in JavaScript I know that in like processing and things like that you get these really nice like classes right like vectors But we don't get that in JavaScript So I'm not even going to pass in any arguments to set the X&Y I'm literally just going to return an object that has the X and the Y set of zero Like I'm just going to go super simple today I know this is not necessarily how you would always do it But this is definitely going to suffice just so that we don't lose time on creating this very fancy like very correct vector So now we can actually just get these objects that we can get the X&Y values out of So a vector is really just trying to denote like a point on the screen itself The next thing we want is to Create a tile so we need to be able to actually draw like either a forward line or a leaning back line So that's the next thing that we're going to do as well. So I think we might write this first I guess we're going to have another function that does a bunch of loops as well to draw the tiles So maybe we can just do create art because that's what we're actually going to create So these are just my placeholder functions And then we can actually get started writing them So as you saw on the whiteboard All we really want to do is just kind of split up each screen into tiles and then just either Generate a random number and based on that we're either going to do like the leaning line or the the falling back line. So Maybe we could just write the function to create the tile So, what do we need to do with this we need to have a random number, right? So I'm just going to call it num and then in JavaScript I think we can just do math dot random and we're just going to take like The math dot random number because we can use this pretty pretty easily So we need to kind of now create one of two conditions, right so we can just create our empty conditions at this point So I'm just really saying if num is more is greater than 0.5 We want to do a thing Otherwise we want to do another thing, right? So so let's just set up this rule It's going to be super arbitrary because it doesn't really matter which one you start with Maybe this one is leaning Let's do leaning forward because that's a little easier to do the for the first time and then this else statement is going to be Falling back. I guess that's the easiest way to do it. Like how do you describe this down normally like leaning forward fully back? Forward slash and backslash. Yeah Of course that's so smart. So my first computer was a Commodore 64 this so this is making me feel super nostalgic I never actually did this on the Commodore 64 though Might have been because I didn't have the internet so I didn't really like find any of these treasures online. So There's a you know, there's a whole book just about basically this one line of code called 10 print Which is written by a bunch of different authors. I've talked about it. I don't think I have it here I want to buy it. Yeah, I have copied it downstairs. This sounds so awesome The Sun circle, okay. All right. So What we want to do is we want to establish like two vectors, right? We want to have like a the start of the line and X&Y and then the end of the line and X&Y So I'm gonna create some new variables. So we're gonna have Start no wait line start. Let's call it line start. I Don't know what I'm doing Okay, line start equals and then we're just going to create a new vector So we're going to just like manipulate the X&Y afterwards So now I just need an end line Wait line start. I'm getting so confused. Okay line and So we should have just copy pasted this line, but it's cool. It's good to type stuff. So you remember it Okay, so now we just need to basically say, you know, like we can set these new values Depending on like, you know what the random number was and then we're gonna actually draw the line So I just realized that I'll actually need An argument in here. So we're going to need to pass in the whoops the screen Instance so that we can actually like call a method on it So you'll see why we need that later on but I'm just going to do it so I don't forget Okay, so if the number is more than 0.5 we want to lean forward so that means that our tile size Is going to need to kind of come into play with this. So I think we actually need some more Variables to pass in because the tile needs to know exactly what tile it's actually on So I'm going to pass in a tile vector. So we're actually going to make use of vectors later on as well Now we can do something like just pretend that that vector exists We can have tau dot X and tau dot Y and I want you to think of the tile X and tau Y as like the top Left corner of that tile where it starts so that kind of gives us our anchorage and from there we can start generating lines This is probably not the correct way to do it as As in the book, but this is sort of how I'm going to figure it out So I'm interested to hear in how you do it, but this is how I'm gonna do it So I feel like it's still gonna work out. Okay, there's no such thing as the correct way to do anything I feel like that too, but I'm sorry if I knock the mic for everyone back home I feel like that too But I feel like I'm one of the only people and I feel like I'm from outer space when I'm like it doesn't really matter But let me know if you think it doesn't matter too because I think that's really fun when you stop worrying about that stuff Okay, so if we have our line start and our line end vectors, we have our tile start This is where we want to sort of start doing it. So we want to maybe set up our line start first So our line start X Coordinate if it's leaning forward then it's going to be like right you know in the corner, right so I don't know how else to explain that but it's going to be right at the start because The the forward slash is sort of like yeah, the horizontal starts that way So so if you have a look at it this way You can kind of see that it's starting right in the corner So we can just set that to be the tile dot X because that's the starting point of the tile Then we want line start dot dot Y Okay. So this one is different this time because it's not the Y right at the top It's actually the Y right at the bottom. So we're gonna do Tile dot Y but then we're going to add the size of the tile. So if the tile is a square Then we're going to add the tile size. So we're going to do tile size and then because the X and the Y of the tile because that it actually denotes the start of the tile. It's actually inclusive So I think we also need to take one away just to balance that But we'll see if that's correct because I did this like weeks ago In Australia after I met after I saw Tim Holman's talk, so we're just going to make this up Okay, so now we need to do the Line and coordinates So the line end is going to be like right towards the end of the actual tile itself because it's leaning forward So we can just do tile dot X and then we're gonna plus the tile size I guess and then we're going to do negative one as well because it's inclusive Stop me if this is wrong Because I trust you Daniel much better And then the line end is just going to be I think it's just going to be the tile dot Y because It's sort of like ending at the top of the Y I guess What am I doing? Line end equals tile dot Y that should be it. Yes. Okay I'm hearing encouraging things from Dan right now okay, so That's the leaning forward. So let's do the leaning back. So the line start Dot X so because it's let's actually just like draw a little one here so that we can actually kind of reference it so the the line start X is It's still starting Right at the the start of the tile again, so I feel like we can just do this. I Feel like it the tile X the line start X is always like that So we can like draw the line like from bottom up But we're just gonna do the line from from the top down I guess so there are different ways to do this because you Can draw the line in backwards orders, I guess Okay, so the line Start dot Y is Going to be just the title The title Y right because it's right at the top. It's the start of the tile. We lost the camera Okay, I think right I could yeah it is but I feel like all the others are gonna go down. Yeah I Love it It's so funny Okay, all right, so when did we start we started it like 245 yes, yeah, it's been an hour, okay, okay Okay, so it's gonna be a miracle if we get this on so So line in dot X. Okay. So if the line ends like right at the far part because it's leaning Back it's going to be tau dot X plus The tile size. I feel like I'm just writing exactly the same code as the other one It should be tile X plus tile size minus one, right? That's how I feel. I just feel like this is it just feels so repetitive, but there are super subtle differences with it Oh, sorry, I'm behind like what? Okay, what I'm seeing oops Because that's this is this falling back. Yeah Okay, yeah this stuff melts my brain this is why I can't do it like it's so funny because hardware is like safe and Comforting to me and like this stuff is really scary because it's so much It's so much math and I'm really bad actually at spatial math Like I just don't have a lot of good spatial awareness in my brain in general It's just not how my brain thinks so I really have to put in a lot of effort for this Okay, so it's going to be at the bottom so we need to plus the tile size again minus one inclusive so And then this is minus one Yep, yep, yep, yep, that's right. Okay Okay, so now that we have Now that we have that It's the biggest anticlimax ever It's just gonna be line start I Never do autocomplete because I'm not used to having it in them Line start why right and then it's going to be line. This is going to go on another line line and X and then line and Y and then the color is One and then we don't want it to automatically update because we're gonna be like during so many lines We don't want to just like hit this device and sometimes it can actually overwhelm the devices and it doesn't break the device but it does Kind of just like bottleneck it and then sometimes the messages just don't get through So that's a limitation of like using this way of doing things if you did this directly on the device in C++ You wouldn't actually see that issue Okay, so so that's a tile Can we draw the tiles real quick? So that this stream doesn't go forever Okay, cool, so we want to create the art again, this is a function outside of our screen So we're gonna just pass in screen not scream Okay Okay, so this is where we do our classic generative art like algorithm, which is a nested for loop, right, so we're going to do let's I I equals zero and then I is less than the width of the screen and then I is going to be plus equals to the tile size, right so it's gonna like jump in tile widths Hopefully that makes sense And again, Dan will stop me if I'm going completely off I'm 20 seconds behind Okay, so this is gonna look super similar It's just like J is less than the height because now we're gonna go like tile downwards So then we're going to do J plus equals the tile size again, right? So we really just like staggering this thing So it just can do all the tiles Stop when it gets to the end of the width and then like do the height And then do the next row I guess so it's doing it kind of row by row I guess sort of no way Yes, it is. Okay Okay. So now I think we can just Call. Oh, we need new vectors. So we need to like generate what the tile start and end is, right? whoops So I'm gonna do tile equals new vector. I Feel like this has now become a speed code tile Dot X is equal to I and then tile dots So you can see that if I actually had a proper vector function you could I could just pass in the XY So I realized that that was like something that wasn't so great when I created it, but this is pretty still pretty easy to actually Fix so tile dot X equals I tile dot Y equals J Now we just need to create a tile and then we pass in what did we need? We needed Tile and screen. Oh, that's it. Okay, that's easy Okay, so we create the tile we pass in Our tile object and then we pass in the screen instance just so we can actually call things on it I think that's is that it? That's it. Okay. So after we've created that art So after we've created the art we need to update the screen now, right So like we've sort of like manipulated the screens buffer. That's sort of what's happening under the surface. It's like frame of pixels So now we do screen dot update Because then we're just manually updating it because when we were drawing our lines we were saying like don't don't immediately update So I think that's it I have no idea what I'm doing, but I think this is coming out alright Okay, so we need to call these functions clearly. So I think we can just call them in here So I'm gonna just oops. I don't know my this this is a new keyboard. So I'm still actually figuring out this keyboard to Oh, it's just create art, right? Can I just create the art? That it yeah So we wrote a lot of code before we actually ran this so Let's see if that actually runs. So I am just look let me go. So I'm just doing this So I might actually just clear the screen. There we go. So I'm just running the same file and then like Let's see if it actually works. Oh My god, it actually worked the first go so I'm gonna make this bigger because our tile size is really really tiny Because like yeah, oh wow, oh, can you oh you can see it there It's just doing this. Yeah, but I I think people can see okay So let's let's just change the tile size real quick. Yeah, because like see Dan, it's not scary at all. No Exactly the same code. Yeah, so the tile size whoops. Ooh, what happened there? Okay, so let's let's do a new tile size so I'm just gonna run that again Yeah, do you want to make it even bigger No, I think that's good, okay one thing That's kind of interesting. I so you're this is Rendering it just rendered it once. Yeah, so we just kind of computed the whole screen and then it was like here you go He's like all the pixels. Can you just display the entire screen? So if you wanted to animate something, mm-hmm, you could you would just are you continuously sending the same imagery? Not right now, so you could do that though So you could put this in a game loop and you might have a pretty limited frame size just sorry frame rate Just because of this USB bottleneck But if you wrote the native C++ with the same kind of like thing, yeah You could do it because it was something that's interesting that you can do with the 10 print design is you can just change the probability So right now it's 50% This way versus that way and so you can just we could do it right now But like you could actually since this is all JavaScript and connected you can actually make an interface So you're like altering the probability in real time. That's so cool. Even like right now if you just go to I'm standing in the way. No, you're fine. But if you go to where it's none was greater than 0.5. Yeah Yeah, yeah. So if you just change that to like two or something. Oh, I'm so excited Okay See, this is where I'm like, no idea what I'm doing So does that mean it'll have more forward ones yes So it has a particular quality in that it's much rarer for it to go the other way today I learned yeah That's really cool. I mean this seems so simple. But to me, I'm just I've never explored this stuff before That was me breathing is that's me probably it might be me I don't know cuz I was really excited that it was I Don't know how well that I mean if I can see it here on the monitor, so yeah working But it's there's something that's so beautiful about it. It's really nice Imagine being able to now but this is only work. So one of the questions actually that's in the chat I just yeah earlier you you did allude to this before Yeah But it seems to me that there's kind of a this is really wonderful for like learning and figuring out and making something happen But it feel I guess you could have it wireless you were saying So what what if you wanted to embed this in like a physical installation? It seems unwieldy to have the whole laptop Yeah, your choices would be wireless or like something like a Raspberry Pi exactly So Raspberry Pi is perfect for that if you wanted to still keep the same JavaScript you can also use a really cool device called the The Tesla 2 because it runs JavaScript natively on it. So you still have the same really nice abstractions, but You you can still use Johnny five with it So this isn't always like the last step of like when you're making a cool art thing But it's as you saw it was so quick to prototype with and maybe some people are more comfortable c++ That's probably you I don't know. It's so like Right, so in other words if you're trying to like prototype your idea and figure it out You can do it all the way through Yeah, I'm scripting when you're done. You could be like well now I don't have to debug it and figure it out and choose make all my design choices Yeah, just now I just have the job of porting it Yeah, cuz it feels like you're writing it twice But what's actually happening is you're just testing the idea out because if it didn't really come out that good then You didn't sort of sit there like waiting for it to flash every time and like you can use whatever IDE you want without having to get platform I were working so it just it's a low friction way of doing it Yeah, I do that all the time with you know Even though now I do a lot of my tutorials in p5 and in JavaScript. I'm still sort of like natively my brain Yeah, I just if it's me by myself trying to try out an idea even if I know it needs to be deployed to the web I'll just do it in processing first because I know I can test and iterate in a fluid way and then Figure out the conversion later, which is so funny because I feel like we're opposite like I think you're an absolute wizard because you're really good at processing and You probably are like, what is this JavaScript? Although I've seen you're very good at JavaScript too because you're writing neural networks and stuff like that But I do watch people use cinder and like processing and it's just not my natural grab bag Like my natural grab bag is like canvas and JavaScript or no JS and Jody 5 or something like that So so there's another question here, which is I don't know if you know the answer to this But if I'm using an Arduino Nano does the standard for modest still work? Yeah, that's a really good question So it does still work the reason so you might have actually noticed that that screen updates really slowly So the reason for that is on an Arduino Uno I could get away with sending So I'm just sending really really small packets at a time so that the device doesn't get overwhelmed So a lot of people have said to me you should make older JS faster But what's what's different about an Arduino Nano is that it emulates its USB connection? So it's using some of its programming memory and like time and cycles to like keep that open So if I send too much it literally just kind of craps out and like I'm not doing anything So I have to send this in a very careful way I have done some experiments and I've been able to speed it up like by ten times But it does make it on the cusp of ruining a Nano or something like that But yes, the answer is yes You can and that's because I made my library so small that it does actually work So one question that I have so it to me was interesting to watch this because I'm so used to doing the programming to like Generate a design like this But I'm not used to doing the programming to put the design like this in something that isn't like HTML 5 canvas or processing the higher level API. In theory though, it would be possible I don't know whether it would be worth doing this or not But with a display like this There's no reason why you couldn't do drawing to like a canvas object with a higher level API and then read the pixels of that Canvas one at a time and transfer them here Yes Did you already do this? With Node you would need like some kind of phantom browser canvas thing Let me let me show you this thing even with like web sockets You can have it running in the browser and then just send the data from the canvas. Yes Yes, so you could draw on it and then have the drawing appear here I want to show you I wish we had time to do this and I do I did have a working demo on my laptop of this working So I'm like no I have no idea if that link is gonna go anyway. Okay one sec So I do have a couple examples I want to show you really quick if that's okay. Yeah And it's literally it's gonna take like one sec Want so I have this thing that uses canvas where you can make your own fonts for this screen And it's actually using canvas. So this is giving you the preview Yeah, so what this does is you can put in the font that you want to use you can do like the size and As you sort of change that it's changing and this is literally a canvas And then you change the threshold for what you want like the kind of smooth stuff to be right? And then when you're happy with it, it goes through every pixel in the canvas file and it gives you a font file Oh, wow, and then that converts it into like a framebuffer JSON file that's compatible with my library. The next thing It's way cooler so I saved it to the end but my friend hexalint She's amazing Oh, she doesn't have it at quick quick So it's called OLED JS designer. So she took my library Oh, wow, this is exactly what I was just talking about. Yes, and like you're gonna lose it when you see this It's like a thing where you can draw and you can download the image buffer. So that's like really really small You can do like a little bit of like a little bit of like a little bit of like a little bit of like You can download the image buffer But what I did recently that I had on my laptop that I can't show you is I had Johnny five running in the browser And it's sent it in the USB Well, it's really hacky it's not actually officially supported because you can't send a sig into the browser so you have to like put it in a web worker and then But you can also do it as a web socket so I could send that to my node process and then update it So that's what she wanted to eventually do with it And I've been I've basically been forking this project to my own GitHub and like messing around with it So I've gotten it working with web USB with Wi-Fi Via like MQTT and then also with web sockets So I wish I could show you but hexalint is awesome because she made this well Did you think one is you just have to come back and do another tutorial? or If you're doing follow-up with any of this like coding with it or trying more stuff on your twitch channel Yeah, I point people towards that. Yeah, totally find that but yeah, because for me it's like I would love the idea of just like using the Like the p5 drawing API to say like ellipse line rectangle created. I mean, obviously you're limited. It's black and white It's very small. It's 128 by 64. It's so much So, you know me, you know, but interesting to think about how you You know you had to you had to jump through so many hoops just to like draw the line Yes and so to be able to have something that's kind of like gives you some of that and Not because just to like allow you to explore an experiment more exactly And I wanted to really quickly show you the Floyd Steinberg So I have this all right, so I had to make like all of these other modules to get this to work so I have this thing called PNG to LCD and you just give it like a PNG yeah, it uses Floyd Which I had to implement Yeah And then does that look like Floyd Steinberg to you? Did I implement the algorithm correctly like that looks like yeah So you can basically give it like the exact size like image you want and then it will actually give you the OLED JS like native Buffer that like OLED JS uses and then you can actually do non-div it as well And then I have a thing saying it's not always gonna be perfect So yeah, okay, so a couple other things. Yes people are really Slightly off topic people really want to know about the key. Okay. Yeah, let's do that You don't have to unplug it probably because we can well it's just oh, yeah, that's true I can hold it for you if you want maybe we can So this is the GK 64 I tweeted photos of it yesterday, so if you go on my Twitter account on no up cat It is it is the kit that came with a wooden case, so it's really hard to build this well But it's from master up and they have limited runs and I've been waiting like six months for this thing, but it is awesome It's really really beautiful go to my Twitter account like twitter.com slash no up cat and I put a Custom set of keycaps on it too. So I did actually get these custom They're just a limited batch bespoke artisanal hipster keycaps but I love this so much because Check out my tweets because I just couldn't stop going on about it and it has like 700 likes or something But it's a really really nice keyboard and I've been typing on it this whole time and it is just an absolute pleasure to type on so I Yeah, so like first of all my keyboard I've been saying this this this laptop the E key barely works and also I really like I'm gonna show you this actually. Oh, yeah, so it has these like lighting effects And it's not stepped like that that's just the camera making it look flickery but it's really nice Checking here see if there any more questions Any hardware list to be able to follow up with your live stream? I'm not sure I understand that question So I think you know if I were to rephrase that question like what's the kind of stuff that you typically do on your live stream? Yeah, is it like this is it totally are you working on your own projects? Well, sometimes I'm literally working on like Oleg JS like I've worked on this before I get pull requests on it I get issues or you know Like I've been meaning to refactor this and modernize it because I wrote it like three or four years ago So like I've learned a lot about JavaScript since then and just like hardware API's So I just generally work on my own open source stuff. So something that I work on a lot and I've been Working on this a ton recently is AVR go Arduino, which is what formatter party is using to like flash the code And Arduino actually uses this in the Chrome OS editor So like Arduino is using it which is terrifying to me. So I try and keep it up to date cool So that's the kind of stuff I work on most of the time is open source. Sometimes I'll just play with stuff. Yeah There's a question about the keyboard Can you control the lights of the keyboard in software? Yes, and so is there an API to it that you could actually like There's like a win radically control I think they probably would be I really want to write a driver for it in JavaScript now But that's like besides the point but you can actually so like see how I'm hitting that there and there's like different Programs so I can cycle through them, but you have a lot more control Just to have a disco, okay We have we have like a good 15 minutes before you need to okay 10 minutes. I'm not guys before we should shut down And I promise it's really smooth. It's just that the green screen is gonna go away But here it's still nice Yeah, okay. So wait So there's these effects you can do such as when I hit a light it ripples But let me let me actually turn this back on. So there's all these different color settings and then there's like the cycling rainbows We just saw So you can fully control this with like the actual Programming software, but it does come with these pre-built ones. So you can actually do that if you really want to But I like the pre-built one so far. I mean I got this yesterday, so I haven't really programmed it yet But yeah, I'm so glad everyone's excited about it It was so nice to type on because I'm just used to mechanical keyboards now, so I brought my own So I think this is an interesting I saw this kind of I mean this is what so this is a question from Mitch in the chat and this is a kind of I saw this discussion this kind of discussion comes up all the time I know it's when I'm live streaming. I turn over the chat people were discussing The question is how does JavaScript improve Arduino and I mean I guess I think it's an interesting question to think about like is that I mean is that that's not really say the goal of What you're doing right to improve there? Do we know it's to just have different pathways into doing exactly into the same doing the same thing? Yeah, so I actually wrote a magazine article about this But it's not out yet, so I can't tell you about it, but it's coming out soon I'll just keep an eye on my Twitter But essentially the only thing that I think JavaScript adds to this because there's obviously drawbacks to it is the accessibility of hardware So like did you feel less? Intimidated as a result of just seeing what happened today. Yes, I Mean yes, you know like to me what one thing that helped me But this is a bit this is it's just the fact that you were kind of using it to then draw to a screen I'm kind of like Oh safe happy place I tried so like that I sort of like I like that whereas I might if this were more about controlling a servo motor But still like I can see the value of being able to it's one of the things I love about this is the fact that You're doing all this stuff with node and for me What I see what I use node for often receive students as I to P using no forces like glue that binds everything together So once I mean no, it's like I could use like the Rita dot JS You know text you know natural language processing no exactly Yeah, as opposed to if you're just on Arduino even though I might like oh Maybe I'm comfortable enough in C++ to write a for loop to do forward and backslashes Like to be able to then reach out and talk to like anything and like use any other packages Yeah, I think exciting if I wanted to generate poetry on this suddenly have no packages that is an excellent point so what you're saying is that instead of having to rely on just the raw processing power that the Arduino has or with the Fact that it doesn't have Wi-Fi. Yeah You know if you want to have a really cheap really low power device you can just be controlling it with a Slightly smarter computer instead and then you have access to all this stuff That's a really good point because I can't remember the last time someone ran a neural network on an Arduino But yeah, so I mean that's the thing like ultimately there's a there's a lot of limitations here And there's a lot of you know almost ages this were like wasted energy in the fact that there's this whole computer here Yeah, you could just write the algorithm to generate this pattern Just on the Arduino itself, but in terms of learning about how this stuff works in terms of reaching out and like Talking to all sorts of other things to be able to have like an interface I mean now it's possible that we can have a browser instance with an interface that controls everything that's happening exactly so many exciting possibilities Yeah, I'm really glad you brought that up because for me it was usually just about accessibility But I never thought about using it as like a more powerful processor So I don't know how annoying this is gonna be to you, this is this was requested Yeah, I can do that so you don't have to read very many and you can pick whatever you want I love this okay. I can't do as good of a job as your bills though like he like nailed it. Oh, yeah Yeah, yeah, okay, so I'll try I will try a table of random digits Just in case there's any really good exciting last question, okay, so Table of random digits page 247 6 305 6 1 0 8 7 2 3 4 1 7 3 3 4 7 1 1 1 3 6 3 0 3 1 2 8 5 Oh three six two one nine three nine seven four Okay, so I think that's pretty good for today. I'm just checking making sure there's okay, blah blah lots of interesting discussions All right, so let me come back over here for a second So what what I will hope to probably do I will Confer with math blank here in the slack channel who does video editing? Couple things one is I know that Suze takes a lot of care to do Captioning for all of your live streams, and this is something that I haven't I mean that I I've thought about and I aspire to do more of and I have had a lot of really Wonderful generous contributions from the community YouTube has a tool where you can just log right into the oh, yeah, it's really cool All right and contribute captions there are also the auto-generated captions, but especially I think you mentioned this on Twitter especially with technical stuff so You did what you use here is a service called rev So as an experiment for me to learn about this service and sort of see if it's feasible for me to use it going Forward I'm gonna caption this live stream with rev. Thank you and Then also I will confer with math blank, but sometimes what I often do is take this longer live stream Which has been maybe about and two hours I Think you're long yeah This down to like a 30 to 45 minute little just sort of the nuts and bolts of this particular project. Yeah and So that may be coming But if you are watching this right now because you're watching this live or if you're somehow still watching this full Please check this videos description to find out about No op cats Channel Twitter or website all that sort of stuff You can see it here. I'm standing in front of it We were talking about maybe I will come and do a little something on the twitch livestream. There's like an exchange That's what people do in this world of YouTube twitch And Thank you so much for coming in doing I didn't have kind of my goal for starting that when I sort of started in this channel started to get like some subscribers was to have more more guests to try to show the range of things that people are doing besides and range of Voices and ideas besides my own little thing weird thing that I do and so I've had a whole bunch in the last few weeks Which has been really exciting and I hope to continue to do more of this So if anybody has suggestions for guests and other people that I that to invite to the coding train You can reach me at shift men on Twitter if you have other questions about this project Yeah, hit me up at no op cat which is spelled You can call me new cat if you really want and That's that so I'm gonna do the awkward thing Which is just I don't do you have a good system for ending a live stream? Yeah, I usually just wave But but I also want to say this is like a big dream come true for me like in your computer Like I was so excited last night that I dreamed that we went upstate and then we did this on a hill with a big Projector and it was like live in person, but it was also streamed somehow in the middle of the wilderness So I just want to say thanks. This is welcome. Thank you. So I would love actually I've always I do have this sort of Dream slash fear of doing like some coding train episodes in front of like a live like live live live live But someday people are saying all sorts of nice things in the chat lots of clap emojis So, okay, so I'm okay, so we'll do we'll wait Okay, real with Gabriel would say always remember to feed your curiosity, but I'm not gonna steal his tagline I'm only just that's just a shout out to Gabriel. I need a tagline. You feel like I don't have one either I just wait So we're gonna wait and I'm gonna hit stop streaming in three two one",
