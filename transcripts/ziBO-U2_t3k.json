    "transcription": " Hello and welcome to another coding challenge. In this coding challenge I'm going to demonstrate a lot of different techniques and what I'm going to do is I'm going to build a Mad Libs generator from scratch in the browser using JavaScript and reading data from a Google Sheet. So there's gonna be a lot of pieces to this but hopefully by the end you'll learn something and be able to take a creative riff on what I'm doing to do something that's more original than me just literally creating the exact Mad Libs. Now you might be wondering what Mad Libs are. It's a word game where you have to come up with nouns and adjectives and adverbs words of different parts of speech and those get substituted into a story and then when you read the story it's funny. You know I've been thinking a lot about the history of Mad Libs and the creators of Mad Libs Leonard Stern and Roger Price and you know they must be laughing all the way to the shoe. Where's my drumroll? I have to credit at Josh Gorin for that joke I don't know if he came up with it but he told me that joke. But bad joke aside let's see what happens if we can try to create a Mad Libs generator in the browser. So the first thing I want to do first of all is come up with the actual structure of the Mad Libs itself. So I have here a text file and this is what it's going to be. Blank! exclamation point they said blankly as they jumped into their blank and flew off with their blankety blanks. So I need an exclamation, an adverb, a noun, an adjective, and a plural noun. So I could say zoinks! they said joyfully as they jumped into their unicorn and flew off with their colorful rainbows. Right? So this is the idea of a Mad Lib. So the first thing I want to do is figure out where am I going to pull the words from. You know with a project like this I probably shouldn't go straight to making the data source and I should just actually do the Mad Lib generation in a JavaScript program and then connect the data source but I'm going to take my own advice and go backwards. So yeah nobody, people, there's a lot of thumbs down, a lot of dad joke yeah in the, sorry that was terrible. Maybe we'll edit the joke out. Anyway coming back, start this video over. So one thing I want to do is I first I want to make a Google Sheet. So I'm going to make, oh no I don't want to make a Google Sheet. Actually I'm going to do this with a Google Form. So I'm going to make a new Google Form, more, Google Form and this is my, no thanks, this is my Mad Libs form and I need to create a bunch of questions. So I just want a text question. Where do I find short answer? So I want an adverb and then, and it's going to be required, and then I want a duplicate. I want, what did I say I wanted? An adverb, oh no, an exclamation, exclamation. Then I want an adverb, duplicate. Then I want a noun, adjective, plural, noun. Noun, noun, duplicate, adjective, duplicate, plural, noun. And then I can trash this one and save. This is Mad Libs form and what I want to do now is share this, get a shareable link, shorten URL. Those of you who are watching this in the live stream, somebody copy that, screenshot that, copy that down, share it in the chat. I'm not going to leave it up to you. And then please, family friendly language please, if you wouldn't mind. And I should be able to do responses and connect this to a new spreadsheet. And here now is my spreadsheet. So as people submit responses, I should see those responses appear in this particular spreadsheet. And in the chat, tell me if nobody was able to get it and I'll sort of pause making this video and edit the pause out, but right now I'm going to keep going. Okay, and people in the chat are pointing out, by the way, that I could use one of my other video examples like the Rita library, which gives you random nouns and random words. I could query something called Wordnik. But in this coding challenge, I want to show you how to get aggregate data from users and use them in your JavaScript program. And of course you could write a database program. You could spin up a web server and a Mongo database and all this stuff or you could connect to some service and save your data. But what I'm suggesting to you, if you want to prototype your idea and get data from users really quickly, a Google form and a spreadsheet is a really quick and easy way to do it. Okay, I'm back. I paused for a bit to let people submit stuff and you can see now people are submitting into the Google form and I've got lots of exclamations, lots of adverbs, lots of nouns, lots of adjectives. So what I need to do now is get this data into my program. And there are a variety of ways you could do this. There's something called Sheetsu, S-H-E-E-T-S-U.com. There are probably other JavaScript libraries and frameworks for grabbing data from a Google Sheet. But I'm going to use something called Tabletop.js. One, it's open source and free and it's pretty easy to use. So what I'm going to do here is the first thing I want to do is grab the Tabletop.js library. So I'm on this GitHub repository. All the links that I'm using in this video will be in the description of this video and I apologize for my scratchy voice. I've got a bit of a cold today. So I'm going to click under source. I'm going to go to Tabletop.js. Then I'm going to go to raw and I'm just going to save this JavaScript library into my libraries folder, Tabletop.js. So now you'll see in my code here what I have is I have a text file where I'm keeping track of my mad libs. I've got my JavaScript code. I've got an HTML file. I have p5 libraries because I'm using p5 as I usually do as a sort of base JavaScript framework to use for various DOM manipulation tasks and then also Tabletop.js for getting the data. So now what I need to do is figure out how can I get the data from that spreadsheet. So let's look here and oops. Let me go back to Tabletop.js and I'm going to look at the readme. So this is how easy. All I need to do is call this Tabletop.init function and I need to give it a key and a callback function. And simple sheet being true means I'm going to work with a sheet that just only has one tab. So this is going to make things really, really easy. So all I need basically is to take this code. I'm going to copy paste this code. I'm going to go to my code and I'm going to put it in setup. And let's just see what happens when I do this. So now I'm going to come back here, hit refresh. Now Tabletop is not defined. So I saved that JavaScript library but I forgot to add it to my index.html. So I need to also have a reference to it in index.html. Let's try again. And we can see this data came in. Now this data came in from some demo spreadsheet available from that Tabletop makes available to use with an example. I need to get the key to my spreadsheet. So if I go over to my spreadsheet here, where is the key? Well it's just this crazy long thing. Now this actually isn't going to work because I missed a crucial step. But I'm going to copy paste this long key here. And I'm going to come back here and where, where, where, where am I in my code? I'm going to add this here. Right. So that's the key. So if I add this here I should see everything in the spreadsheet here just in that data object. So I'm going to come back and hit refresh. But I'm going to get an error. It says access control allow origin header is present on the requested resource. It is not allowed access. The reason why it's not allowed access is in order for this spreadsheet to be available to this program in this very simple way without authenticating in any way whatsoever I need to publish it to the web. So there's an option in Google Sheet which is here where I can go under file and look here publish to the web. So again I wouldn't do this with like hey everybody send me your social security numbers or username and passwords. I wouldn't use a Google Sheet for that. But with a sort of quick crowd sourced form you can do that. So I'm going to do publish to the web and it should say entire document web page. I think that's all I need. And I'm going to say publish and assure you want to publish. Yes. OK. And now it's published and I should be able to go back and refresh my program. Look at this. This is beautiful. This is live. This is live. As people every time I refresh as people enter submissions I've got more and more. And you can look at this. I've got an array of objects. Adjective adverb exclamation noun plural noun and the timestamp. So there's not a lot of metadata here other than the timestamp. But you know a Google form you can ask people for lots of things. You can say hey make a Google form for people to type out their dreams. So you wake up in the middle of the night enter their dreams. You've got this vast spreadsheet. You need to have an audience and figure out a way to people. But this is a quick way to get data. I'm excited about this. I hope you are too. So this is really easy now. So now in my program what I want to do is I want to clean this up a little bit. So one thing I want to do is I want to pull this function out because this is really where all my work is going to happen. And I want to make this a separate function which is a generate Mad Lib. Actually you know what I want to do actually is I just want to I want to just say got data. I'm just going to call this got data. And I what I want to do is have a global very quick solution to just have a global variable called all data. It could probably come up with a better name than that. And I'm going to say all data equals. No I'm just going to call it data. I'm going to call it sheet. Now let's call it data. Data equals and I'll just call this stuff. So basically what I want to do here is when I refresh this page I now have a global variable called data that has all of the entries in it. So now let me let me let me here also create a button. Let me say create button generate Mad Lib and I'm going to say var button equals create button and I'm going to say button dot mouse pressed button dot mouse pressed generate. So I'm going to create a function that generates the Mad Lib here. So I just want to make sure this is working. I'm going to say console dot log generate. Whoops. And then I want to add something I want to go and just into my page. I just want to take this and I want to put it into the page just so people can see it. So I'm going to make a paragraph at the top that has that. So we can see. Oh and I forgot to add to my JavaScript code. P5 by default creates a HTML5 canvas for drawing but I don't need a canvas. So you can see this is my page now. It has it has sorry it has all of the it has the Mad Libs listed there and has a button now. So whenever I click generate all I'm doing right now is console logging the word generate. But I now want to generate a version of the Mad Lib from all the stuff that people have sent. OK. So now here we go. So let's do that. So first thing I need is this text. And there's a variety of ways I could do this. I'm going to do something I'm going to say text equals and I make this a global variable. But what I'm going to do instead of these blanks is I'm going to create like a secret code for myself. Exclamation. They said adverb. I'm just going to put this into their noun and flew off with their adjective and plural noun. So I'm going to I'm going to just I'm going to do this as like a secret code to myself because I what I'm saying is whenever I say dollar sign dollar sign the name of something dollar sign dollar sign. This is something I want to search for in that string and replace. So the first thing I just want to do is say create P create P what that text. So let's just see if that appears. OK. So that appears. Now what I need to do is run. I can use the replace function with regular expressions to replace those things with data that's coming from the database itself. So let me look at this again. The data is a big array and each object has. Now what I could do here. Oh I wish I had made. Do you think I could change this. I wish I didn't have that space there that might cause me some issues. It might be fine but I'm going to go back to the spreadsheet just to be sure about this. I'm going to change this heading to just plural noun and then I'm going to I'm going to go back to my code run it again when we look at data we look at one of them great plural. So what I actually want to do is I want to have these things match what's in here in the regular expression. I don't know if this is really going to be useful but let me just match it exactly. Exclamation adverb. I'm going to add a noun adjective plural noun. OK. So I just wanted to adjust that have the capitalization match because what I want to do is what I'm going to do the following. Sorry. Thinking about this I want to say bar mad lib equals text dot replace and I want to match any time there's dollar sign dollar sign dot star question mark dollar sign dollar sign. So I want to match any place where I have dollar sign dollar sign dot star and then I just want to I'm going to just have a function called replacer that way I can like kind of do this in its own function. Right. Remember with the replace method in JavaScript I can pass a callback and I want to capture this middle thing as a group. So the arguments are the full match and then group one which is really the part of speech. So what I want to do is now say I have this. OK. So let me just let me just return. Test. Let me just make sure this is working. So this whole thing is working and I want to create P with that mad lib. So what I did is I'm looking for any time I put this secret code in the text. I want to match it and then replace it with the word test. So let's refresh this. That didn't seem to work. So let's let's look at text is that. And let's let's let me try my regular expression. Oh you know what. These are meta characters. The dollar sign for God is end of line. So I need to escape that. I totally forgot. So these have to be escaped. So maybe I should have picked something else as my secret code but those have to be escaped. So that should do it. Great. So you can see test as oh and what did I forget now. It only did the first one. So I need the global flag. So I need the slash G for that's the global flag to do all of them. So test they said test as they jumped into their test and flew off with their test test. But now what I can do is I could replace it with the part of speech. Let's just see what that does. Exclamation they said adverb as they jumped into their noun and flew off with their adjective plural noun. This is great because now I have the kind of thing it is which I can use to look up the particular thing in this array. So the first thing I might want to do is just pick a random element from that array. So let me pick a random element from that array. So I'm going to say entry equals random data. Now does data just an array itself. It is. So the random function in P5 is just a function if you give it an array it'll give you a random thing from that array. Let me just show you here in the console random data. I got one. I got another one. I got another one etc etc etc. So you can see how somebody put that in. Someone's really trying to mess with me and put that in as an entry. I see you out there. Who's ever doing that. OK. So I pick a random one and then what do I return data. Now normally in JavaScript this is a this is a thing that you might not be aware of. Oh I'm excited about this and I'm going to be squished. Something's wrong with the aspect ratio of this camera. But if you have an object entry and I say now colon. Why am I saying dog when I could say rainbow. Right. So this is my object. Normally you would say entry dot noun and you would get rainbow. But guess what. Another way to say this is entry bracket bracket. Now this looks like it suddenly is an array and I would need to give it an index but I don't have to. If I give it a string like noun this is actually looking up the property that is named with the text inside that string. So I can dynamically pull a particular thing based on what part of speech I matched by saying return entry bracket POS. Right. Remember I matched exclamation or adverb or noun and in those objects that's what those things are called exclamation adverb or noun. So now if I do this and go back here. Oh Smurf they said lively as they jumped into their Phoebus and flew off with their low forms. I'm a little bit afraid to just keep doing this because I'm hoping that people are using family friendly happy go lucky language. But let's try let's be bold and try one more. Hooray they said carefully as they jumped into their lamb and flew off with their tall bananas. So we've got some great options here and you can see instantly this every time I refresh the page I'm going to get more and more possibilities. And there's so much so much I could do more with this. Right. You know this is a very simple mad lib. I could do some natural language processing like I could make sure it's actually a plural noun and if it's not I could pluralize it or I could check to see if it is a valid noun. There's so many things I could do in terms of how to making this better in terms of a mad lib generator. But what I'm asking you to do it in a way that if you're watching this video is think about what might be a creative experiment that's your own weird word game possibility that you could do where you crowdsource data from people. So make a Google form ask your friends to fill out that Google form get a JavaScript program that reads from that Google form and visualize what people have entered mash it up make a poem out of it whatever. I'm sure you have more creative ideas and strange weird Internet things that you could try to make by doing this idea. But it's a really quick way of having an instant database with crowdsourced information. So hopefully you got something from seeing this little mad libs generator. If you make your own actual mad libs generator please share it with me so I can take a look and be inspired by your own work and I'll see you in a future coding challenge.",
